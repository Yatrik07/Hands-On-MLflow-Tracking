# MLflow Hands-On Tutorial 📚

Welcome to the **MLflow Hands-On Tutorial** repository! This notebook is designed to guide you through the core concepts and features of **MLflow** for managing machine learning workflows, including experiment tracking, model deployment, and versioning.

## 🚀 Overview

In this notebook, we will cover the following key topics:
- **Experiments in MLflow:** Understand how to create and manage experiments.
- **Deleting Experiments:** Learn how to safely delete experiments when needed.
- **MLflow Tracking:** Explore the concept of tracking machine learning experiments and their parameters.
- **Experiments vs. Runs:** A comparison of experiments and individual runs in MLflow.
- **MLflow UI:** Get hands-on experience with the MLflow UI for easy monitoring and comparison.
- **Remaining MLflow Queries:** An overview of other essential MLflow queries.
- **MLflow Models:** Learn how to save and load models with MLflow.
- **MLflow API:** Understand how to interact with MLflow programmatically.
- **Saving a Model to Local Filesystem:** Steps to persist your model locally using MLflow.
- **Custom Models:** Guide to working with custom models in MLflow.
- **Model Registration:** How to register models in MLflow's Model Registry for version control.
- **Model Signature:** Learn about model signatures to define and validate the input-output schema of models.

## 🧑‍💻 What Will You Learn?

- How to effectively track experiments and monitor the progress of machine learning models.
- How to use MLflow’s Tracking API to log metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- How to register models in the **Model Registry** and use versioning for managing models across different stages.
- How to utilize **MLflow's UI** to easily compare and analyze experiments.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts Covered

- **Experiments vs Runs:** Understand the distinction between experiments (groups of runs) and individual runs (specific executions of code).
- **Model Registration:** Store models in MLflow's Model Registry and access them across different projects or environments.
- **Model Signature:** Ensure that input-output signatures are correctly defined for each model version in the registry.
